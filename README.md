# kallimachos
This repository contains resources made available by the project [Kallimachos](www.kallimachos.de).

It provides you with an IPython-Notebook tutorial explaining how the output of the [Kallimachos Preprocessing Pipeline](https://gitlab2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/kallimachos/KallimachosEngines) can be used for subsequent experiments. As an example, it shows the generation of character networks from literary text in a step by step process.
